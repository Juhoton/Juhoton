## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a fifth-year university student finishing up bachelorâ€™s degree and studying masterâ€™s at the same time.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning fullstack development with Web Software Development Aalto mooc (https://fitech101.aalto.fi/en/courses/web-software-development)

ðŸ”­ Examples of code I've written can be found in pinned repositories "Yatzy".

I have also done some paid work for a private game project with c#.
