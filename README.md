## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a fifth-year university student finishing up bachelorâ€™s degree and studying masterâ€™s at the same time.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning fullstack development

ðŸ”­ Examples of code I've written can be found in pinned repositories "Yatzy".

I have also done some work for a private game project with c#.
