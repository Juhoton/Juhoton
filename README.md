## Hi there 👋

I'm a Master's degree Software Engineering student, in which I'm planning to graduate in the spring 2026.

💬 Looking for Master's Thesis work opportunities and a full-time job after graduating.

🔭 Examples of code I've written can be found in pinned repositories.

I have also done some paid work for a private game project with C#.
